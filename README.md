# My Portfolio

This portfolio was created to serve as a professional portfolio page using React. The portfolio presents a responsive layout, and presents my numerous well-developed projects.

## Installation

Visit the site at [this link](https://tayskully.github.io/professional-portfolio/)
In order to get the full experience, users must view the portfolio at both a desktop screen size and mobile screen size.

## Usage

You may scroll up and down on this page, click the links to jump to the content you crave, expand the size of the browser window, or simply open the link in a mobile device.

It should look something like this:
